# Several_Projects

This repository contains some projects that I did between 2012 and 2016 when I started to learn programming at the age of 14. 

Because of my curiosity, and long before studying Computer Science, I wanted to put into practice what I was learning on the internet about programming and these are some projects that I still have. 

I started learning some basics of web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The coolest thing that I did with these technologies is a rock-paper-scissors game using JavaScript.

After that, I got my hands dirty by studying a backend language. First, I chose the C language because I thought it was the hardest one I could study and it would be great in order to perform well in college. Later, after having learned the basics, I started to learn C++. 
With this language, I developed a console application based on the Tetris game, where I was able to implement each of the pieces of this famous game and its movements.
